# NetworkNotifer
Simple application that will notify you when others try to connect to your network

## How it works 
It listens to broadcast DHCP packets send when new devices connect to the network and analyize them to extract information about the connecting device.
*This will not work if the devices use Static IP configuration*

**This application is not designed to be an intrusion detection system**
